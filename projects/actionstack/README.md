ActionStack is a powerful Angular library designed to simplify and enhance state management within your web applications. Developed for the modern Angular developer, it offers a robust and intuitive approach to managing application state, empowering you to create scalable and maintainable UIs. It combines all the good parts of its predecessors and eliminates their shortcomings in asynchronous environment. ```This version does not reference RxJS libarary. This is a customized version of the library for confident developers. Minified and well-tuned.```

*** Added experimental support for [redux-sagas](https://redux-saga.js.org/) ***

## Key Features
- Reactive State Management: Leverages RxJS observables for a reactive approach, keeping your components and views in sync with the latest state changes.
- Immutable State Updates: Ensures predictable and maintainable state transitions by promoting immutability principles.
- Typed State Definitions: Improves developer experience and code clarity with TypeScript support for defining state structures.
- Angular Integration: Seamlessly integrates with Angular concepts like components, directives, and services, providing a familiar development workflow.
- Community-Driven: Backed by an active community and comprehensive documentation, ensuring ongoing support and learning opportunities.

## Benefits
Are you an Angular developer battling against unpredictable state management and tangled asynchronous operations? ActionStack comes to the rescue, offering a powerful arsenal of features to conquer your state management woes.

- Manage Asynchronous Code with Confidence: Fear not the intricate pathways of asynchronous operations! Even within complex data flows, your application remains firmly under your command, banishing unforeseen disruptions and ensuring predictable state updates. No more unpredictable surprises!

- Queue Up Actions for Orderly Execution: Take full command of the action workflow with queueing. Subsequent actions patiently wait their turn, guaranteeing they only fire after their predecessors have completed, leading to a well-organized and predictable state update journey.

- Chain Reactions, Cascading Side Effects Made Easy: Unleash the power of chained side effects! Actions can trigger additional actions, creating a streamlined and organized flow that simplifies complex logic. Forget about messy code - embrace the elegance of cascading side effects.

- Action Defusion, Ordering Chaos: ActionStack guarantees the exclusive execution of actions and their descendants within a dedicated context, preventing interference from concurrent actions. This ensures predictable outcomes and eliminates unintended side effects, particularly crucial for actions interacting with shared resources or performing sensitive operations. This exclusive execution approach significantly enhances the reliability and control over state updates compared to simple action merging!

- Transparent Pipeline, Every Step, Crystal Clear: Gain complete control and visibility into the action processing pipeline. Every step your actions take is laid bare, empowering you to pinpoint any issues and optimize your state management flow.

- Secure Your State, Consistent Updates: The library enforces consistent and predictable state changes, eliminating the risk of unintended modifications and ensuring rock-solid stability.

- Adapt to Any Challenge, Customizable Action Handling: Need a unique approach to handling specific actions? No problem! ActionStack's extensible system of strategies allows you to create custom solutions, making it incredibly flexible and adaptable to your specific needs.

- Performance Insights, Optimize Like a Pro: Analyze action processing times with built-in performance analytics. Identify bottlenecks and optimize your code, ensuring your app stays responsive and delivers a seamless user experience.

- The Legacy of Redux Lives On, Leverage Redux Middlewares: Want to access the vast ecosystem of Redux middlewares? ActionStack welcomes them with open arms, allowing you to leverage existing solutions and expand your state management toolkit further.

# Conclusion
With ActionStack by your side, state management in your Angular applications becomes a breeze. Its distinctive features make it an invaluable tool for developers seeking control, efficiency, predictability and scalability in their Angular applications. Conquer the wild west of state with confidence and build amazing, performant applications!
