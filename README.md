# ActionStack
The ActionStack is a robust state management system designed for Angular applications, following the principles of the Redux pattern. It provides a predictable and centralized way to manage the application state, promoting clean and organized code.

## Features
- **Module Lifecycle Management**: The ActionStack extends the capabilities of a Redux-like store by providing additional methods for managing the lifecycle of modules. It supports initializing the store with a main module and allows dynamic loading and unloading of feature modules. This flexibility facilitates modular development and enhances code maintainability.

- **Side Effects Handling**: A key strength of the ActionStack is its built-in support for handling side effects. Side effects are operations that do not immediately synchronize with the state transition, such as asynchronous actions or effects resulting from state changes. This feature is crucial for managing complex applications where a state change can trigger multiple asynchronous operations.

- **Redux-like State Management**: The ActionStack adopts a Redux-like state management pattern, offering a more robust solution for state management in Angular applications. It follows a unidirectional data flow, where the state is stored in a single immutable object, changes are made through pure reducers, and actions trigger state transitions. The ActionStack seamlessly integrates with RxJS observables, enabling the development of reactive applications.

In summary, the ActionStack is a powerful state management system tailored for Angular applications. It provides comprehensive solutions for handling side effects, organizing code in a modular structure, and managing complex state transitions. This makes it an invaluable asset for modern Angular development, comparable to the capabilities offered by libraries like ngrx.
